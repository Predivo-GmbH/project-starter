/**
 * Feature Coverage Sync Check
 *
 * Reads docs/FEATURES.md (or docs/FEATURE_REGISTRY.md), extracts every feature whose status is
 * "implemented" or "tested", and verifies that each one is actually covered by a test that RUNS.
 *
 * Exit code 1 if any feature lacks real coverage.
 * Run in CI: node scripts/check-feature-coverage.mjs   (BLOCKING — never continue-on-error)
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED 2026-08-21, and why ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This check used to prove only that a test FILE EXISTS on disk (`existsSync`). Open-findings
 * register V2, raised independently by the v13.4 defect-injection auditors: a `test.describe.skip`
 * therefore kept a feature reading COVERED while nothing ran. A file that exists is not a test that
 * runs, so the file check alone made "every feature has a passing test" a convention, not a gate.
 *
 * It now also parses each referenced file and fails when the feature's coverage is entirely skipped
 * (`describe.skip`, `test.skip`, `it.skip`, `.fixme`, or `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'skip' })`).
 * A file with SOME skipped cases still passes — skipping one case is normal; skipping all of them
 * means the feature is untested.
 *
 * The parser is also DIALECT-TOLERANT now, which replaces the old "type the prefix unbolded"
 * convention: `E2E:` and `**E2E:**` are both accepted, as are `**Status:**` and `**Status**:`, and
 * `## F-001` as well as `### F-001`. A markdown formatting choice must never be able to switch a
 * gate off — and measured across the fleet, each repo had quietly patched its own copy to match its
 * own dialect, which is how one canonical script became ten.
 *
 * ⚠ 2026-08-21, SECOND PASS: the skipped-suite detector shipped that morning was DEFEATED BY THE
 * EXACT CASE IT WAS WRITTEN FOR, and the factory audit caught it by planting one. See the comment
 * above `stripSkippedBlocks` — the short version is that removing the `.skip` token left the tests
 * INSIDE the skipped block visible, so a fully-skipped file still reported as covered. Every repo
 * that took the first version is blind to skipped suites until it takes this one. Note that this
 * never broke a build: it caused false PASSES, which is why nothing surfaced it.
